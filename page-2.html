    My name is Annie Ratliff and I am from Plain City, Ohio, a small town west of Columbus.
I am 19 years old as of July 2020 and I have loved art for as long as I can remember. I originally really started getting into drawing when I was 13 years old. I am currently a Freshman at the Cleveland Institute of Art and my intended major is Life Sciences Illustration.
